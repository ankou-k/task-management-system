# task-management-system

This project is a CLI task management system created for my Quality Assurance university class. This system allows users to create, manage, and track tasks and projects. Users can create individual tasks, organize them into projects, set priorities and deadlines, assign tasks to team members, and monitor task progress throughout the completion of the project.

I aim to transition this CLI task managment system into a webapp.

To run the project:
1) Download sqlite to manage the db
2) Run pip install sqlalchemy in the terminal of the project
3) Run construct_db.py to set up the db
4) Run main.py to run the program
